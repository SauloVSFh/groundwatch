assignment 4
	sometimes compounds are not there
	you have nitrate and Mn - conflict in data
	you have nitrate and iron - conflict in data
		delete sample from database
		forgot to filter
		lab exposed sample to air
		dissolved suspended solids
	when all concentrations are too low
		no reduction new water
	if you dont have nitrate and 
	
	the concentration of sulfate very low
		sulphate reducing - reaction takes a lot of time
	manganese but now iron and nitrate
		3
	no nitrate and iron with no mn
		4-6
	only sulphate
		4-6
	mn doesnt have to be there
	sulphate
		= 0 to 2 mg/L
		fair change of SO4 reduction
			4,5-6
		analyze better
			some mixing with seawater
			sulphate chloride ratio
			original concentration before mixing
			
	Mix	
		lookat the anions groups
		no dominant group
		when it falls within the inner triangle
	BEX
		capacity increases with clay minerals and organic matter
		CaHCO3 fw - soil is filled with Ca
		Exchange capacity filled with Ca
		eq 3.5
			reaction to the left - surplus
			to the right - deficit
		BEX is nice only if know that fresh-saline water have taken place
			high Cl concentrations
			Na-Cl waters
			it only works well during this circunstance
			salland case we don't deal with that
			there's no freshening there
