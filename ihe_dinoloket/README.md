# DatabaseNl

This is an unfinished student project developed in IHE Delft. The project was developed in 3 days along with other tasks, and despite it worked well,
it has some limitations. 

##The scripts here can:
* Extract different geological and environmental data from DinoLoket 
* Automate extraction of data
* Gather important for groundwater modeling in a single database
* Automate the change of data types

## Important considerations
* Borehole geology is simplified to be used as an input in Modflow. User can control these features by editting the script.
* The project is also not fully automated and it will be editted as I have time.


## Future of this repo
I intend to transform all of this repo in reliable functions and incorporate it to the repo Utils
